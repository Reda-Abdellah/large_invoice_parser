python main.py <input_file> [options]

Options:
  --output, -o         Output JSON file path
  --config, -c         Custom config file path (default: config.yaml)
  --no-translation     Disable translation features
  --french-output     Generate output in French
  --save-markdown     Save converted markdown for PDF inputs
  --keep-converted    Keep temporary markdown files
```

### Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file to customize the pipeline:

```yaml
results_dir: "pipeline_results"
context_window_size: 8192
max_context_window: 32768
structure_model: "llama3.2:3b"
analysis_model: "llama3.2:7b"
max_chunk_size: 2000
enable_translation: true
```

## Output Structure

The parser generates structured JSON output containing:
- Hierarchical section organization
- Technical specifications
- Item details and quantities
- Pricing information (when available)
